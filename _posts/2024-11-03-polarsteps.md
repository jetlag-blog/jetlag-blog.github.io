### Hello everyone

Tomorrow's the day. At 6.36 o'clock I'll be leaving my house and head to Zurich to the airport.  

For the past week I've been gathering the last few things, making sure I'm prepared for all kinds of weather and temperatures. Not prepared for anything else but I'm sure I'll wing it just fine should complications arise.    

I've packed my backpack, everything is ready now. But in the process I decided that I was ging to leave my laptop at home. I really wish I could bring it along but that would mean bringing a lot of extra equipment, which I ultimately decided wasn't quite worth the effort.  

That doesn't mean this blog will stop existing or that I won't track my trip.  

Instead, I've decided to use [Polarsteps]( https://www.polarsteps.com/TheTravelingSloth/14775088-japan-2024?s=47a812a2-561e-40e0-995a-8ecb62f7456c). I've created a trip and it should automatically track my location and let me upload images. The link above will take you to said trip and if you'd like you can follow me there. There's an app available for iOS and Android, as well as the web version.

I **will** update this blog when I'm back. Timestamps, locations and all. In the meantime though, if you want to stay up to date, I unfortunately have to direct you to Polarsteps. It's just a lot more convenient for this kind of trip.

That's all, only a very short read today but an important update nonetheless.

Thanks for reading, Fabian out!
