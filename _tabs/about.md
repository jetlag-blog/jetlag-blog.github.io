### Welcome to Jetlag!

---

My name's Fabian, I'm a 25 year old from Basel, Switzerland.  
I work as a webmanager in the healthcare sector and do some bug bounty hunting by the side.  
Currently planning to acquire the OffSec Certified Professional+ (OSCP+) certification.  

This blog is first and foremost meant for friends and family but feel free to have a read if you happened to have stumbled across this randomly. If I find the time I'll set up a translation into German for those that struggle with the English version.

I created this blog when I spontaneously decided to go to Japan for 20 days. I had plans to write a physical journal of my adventures but upon request of my coworkers, I turned it into a blog. Henceforth this shall be my digital journal for travels to come, not just my expedition into the land of the rising sun. This blog will be written entirely unfiltered. You've been warned, continue reading at your own discretion.  

If you want to contact me, you can do so at [fabian@swiss.dev](mailto:fabian@swiss.dev).  
For those that have my number, WhatsApp is of course the easiest option.  

If I ever miss an update and you don't see any new posts for a bit, please do not panic.  
While I cannot exclude the possibility of an accident or my untimely demise, it's much more likely that...  
- I didn't have an internet connection
- I broke my laptop
- I was too tired
- I was lazy  

or literally any of a hundred different reasons.  

Knowing myself, I'll probably mess up the commit to Github. This blog is using Jekyll as its framework and is hosted on Github Pages. Not that anyone cares but I felt like mentioning it...  
I am not even sure this whole blog idea will actually work in the first place. Only one way to find out I suppose.
